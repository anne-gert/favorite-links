Favorite-Links & ToDo-List
==========================

Generic project to manage favorite URLs in a start-page like fashion. Each
item can also be associated with a checkbox, so that this can also be used as
a ToDo list.

The favorites.html uses a textual configuration to specify the URLs.
See [help.html](help.html) for more details a definition of the syntax for
the configuration.

The page favorites.html can be accessed and used directly (i.e. hosted by
GitHub) by
<https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/anne-gert/favorite-links/master/favorites.html>.
This opens the links page with default contents that contains more
documentation.

It is also possible to supply one's own contents with the links= URL argument.
The value may be literal contents or an absolute or relative URL, prefixed
with 'url:'. This can also be used with a direct link to GitHub:
<https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/anne-gert/favorite-links/master/favorites.html&links=url:example-links.txt>.

This contents can be edited from the page (via the Gears icon) and stored in
the browser's LocalStorage.
