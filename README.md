Favorite-Links
==============

Generic project to manage favorite URLs in a start-page like fashion.

The favorites.html uses a JavaScript file to specify the URLs in a text-like
manner. See the comments in favorites.html on the syntax of that file.

The page favorites.html can be accessed directly (i.e. hosted by GitHub) by
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anne-gert/favorite-links/master/favorites.html

The contents can be supplied with the links=url:http://... query string.
Alternatively the contents can be kept in the browser's LocalStorage.
