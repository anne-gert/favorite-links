Favorite-Links
==============

Generic project to manage favorite URLs in a start-page like fashion.

The favorites.html uses a text file to specify the URLs.
See [syntax.html](syntax.html) for a definition of the syntax for links.

The page favorites.html can be accessed directly (i.e. hosted by GitHub) by
https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/anne-gert/favorite-links/master/favorites.html
. This opens the links page with default contents.

The contents can be supplied with the links=url:http://... query string.
Alternatively the contents can be kept in the browser's LocalStorage.
