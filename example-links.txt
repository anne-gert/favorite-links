<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
<a href="favorites.html">favorites.html</a> is a single page that can be
configured to show links, organized in sections and blocks. This configuration
can be downloaded via a URL and/or edited in the browser's LocalStorage.
</p>


<a name="usage"></a>
<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>
The standard usage is to open the page favorites.html (or possibly set it as
your homepage). Upon first opening, it shows a default example page.  This
page can be edited by going to the Settings (Gears (&#x2699;) icon) and just
edit and save the textual configuration. It might be a good idea to maintain a
text file with the configuration and copy-paste it into the Settings.<br>
favorites.html can also be opened and used directly from <a
href="https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/anne-gert/favorite-links/master/favorites.html">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to provide the configuration as a URL. This URL can be
provided in several ways:
<ul>
<li>In the configuration txt as <code>url:&lt;URL&gt;</code>.
<li>With the <code>links=url:&lt;URL&gt;</code> URL argument.
<li>With the <code>links-override=url:&lt;URL&gt;</code> URL argument.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This is the order how the configuration is searched:
<ol>
<li><dt>links-override=</dt>: If <code>links-override=configuration</code> is
    provided, that content is used.
<li><dt>LocalStorage</dt>: If a configuration is stored in the browser's
    LocalStorage, that is used. Note that LocalStorage is per domain, so if
    the page is opened from a different domain, a different configuration
    might be present in the LocalStorage.
<li><dt>links=</dt>: If <code>links=configuration</code> is provided, that
    content is used.
<li>If any of the above was non-empty, that configuration is used. If that
    configuration is of the form <code>url:&lt;URL&gt;</code>, then
    &lt;URL&gt; will be downloaded to retrieve the configuration. This URL may
    be absolute or relative.
<li>If none of the above provided a non-empty configuration, a default
    configuration is used which includes examples and some explanation. This
    is the page that is initially shown if displayed without arguments.
</ol>
</p>


<a name="syntax"></a>
<h2>Configuration Syntax</h2>

<p>
The configuration consists primarily of a list of <a
href="help.html#link-syntax">Link Definitions</a>.  The Links form an
hierarchical structure, indicated by the line's indentation:
<ul>
<li><dt>Section</dt>: The first indentation level is the Section. Sections are
    separated by horizontal lines.
<li><dt>Block</dt>: The second indentation level are the blocks within a
    Section. Each Block is a visual area that can be collapsed and expanded.
<li><dt>Item</dt>: The third indentation level are the Items that populate
    the Blocks.
<li><dt>SubItem</dt>: The fourth and higher indentation levels are SubItems
    that are displayed under their respective parent Items
</ul>
Each link can be a hyperlink, have an icon and/or a checkbox.
</p>

<p>
In addition to Links, the configuration also supports comments, different
web-search functions and other directives, see <a
href="help.html#line-syntax">Line Syntax</a> for further details.
